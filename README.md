# PET REGISTRY

This canister helps to keep track of pets in a community.

Owning a pet is a big responsibility, as you need to make sure your pet is registered with us, desexed and microchipped. Registration means that we have a record of your pet's name and your contact details, so that we can return them to you if we find them. It also helps keep the community safe.

Register Features:

- Users can add and delete their pet records to the register.
- Users can update pet information on the register.
- Users can update their contact information on the register.
- Users can also transfer their pet information to another user.
- Users can revoke the transfer of their pet information to another user.
- Users can view the list of pet records they have `pets list`.
- Users can view the list of pet records that have been transferred to them `pending list`. (Records on this list are the pets yet to be claimed by the user).

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd pet_registry/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background --clean

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
npm run gen-deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `npm run gen-deploy`.

## Testing

N/B update actions can only be performed by pet owner.

1. Add a new pet to the registry
2. Try to update your contact information
3. Try to update your pets records
4. Try to transfer your pet information to another user
5. Try to revoke the pet information transfer (provided the new user has not claimed)
6. User can then proceed to claim the pet using the pet id and their new information.
7. Try to delete pet.

N/B: Use the `get_your_principal` function to get the principal of your instance.

## Testing other user instances

Due to the nature of candid ui only allowing the `ic_cdk::caller()` to return an anonymous principal, I added a `new_user_instance` option which allows us to mimick another user account interacting with the canister. If selected, it overrides the `ic_cdk::caller()` and takes the place of the caller and can then be used for testing.

To get another principal for testing run this command in your terminal.

```bash
dfx identity get-principal
```

A good example is transferring an added pet record to the principal generated by the command above, and then claiming that pet record by selecting the `new_user_instance` using that principal.

You can then confirm that everything worked by checking the pets list with the `view_pets_list` function.
